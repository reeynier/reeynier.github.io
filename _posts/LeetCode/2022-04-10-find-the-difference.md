## Description

LeetCode Problem 389.

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: "a"
```

Example 4:
```
Input: s = "ae", t = "aea"
Output: "a"
```

Constraints:
* 0 <= s.length <= 1000
* t.length == s.length + 1
* s and t consist of lower-case English letters.

<br />

## Sample C++ Code


```c
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int n = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i ++) {
            n ^= (s[i] - 'a');
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < t.size(); i ++) {
            n ^= (t[i] - 'a');
        }
        char c = (char)('a' + n);
        return c;
    }
};
```
