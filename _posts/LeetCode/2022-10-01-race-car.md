## Description

LeetCode Problem 818.

Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. Your car can go into negative positions. Your car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions 'A' (accelerate) and 'R' (reverse):
* When you get an instruction 'A', your car does the following:
* position += speed
* speed \*= 2
* When you get an instruction 'R', your car does the following:
* If your speed is positive then speed = -1
* otherwise speed = 1

Your position stays the same.

For example, after commands "AAR", your car goes to positions 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 3, and your speed goes to 1 --> 2 --> 4 --> -1.

Given a target position target, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.

Example 1:
```
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AA".
Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: target = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The shortest instruction sequence is "AAARA".
Your position goes from 0 --> 1 --> 3 --> 7 --> 7 --> 6.
```

Constraints:
* 1 <= target <= 10^4

## Sample C++ Code


```c
class Solution {
public:
    // dp[i] is the minimum number of operations required to reach i.
    // If x == 2^r - 1, the minimum number of operations is r (A^r).
    // If 2^(r-1)-1 < x < 2^r - 1, there're two possibilities:
    // (1) The car reaches 2^(r-1) - 1 and then reverses, accelerates 
    // for another A^j in the opposite direction and reverses again. 
    // Now its position is at 2^(r-1) - 2^j, the remaining subproblem 
    // is to go from current position to i with initial speed, which is dp[i-2^(r-1)+2^j].
    // (2) The car reaches 2^r - 1 and reverses, the remaining subproblem is equal to dp[2^r-1-i].
    int racecar(int target) {
        vector<int> dp(target+1, INT_MAX);
        int r = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= target; i++) {
            if (i == pow(2,r)-1) {
                dp[i] = r;
                r++;
            }
            else {
                int lower = pow(2, r-1)-1;
                int upper = pow(2, r)-1;
                for (int j = 0; j < r-1; j++) {
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], r+1+j+dp[i-pow(2,r-1)+pow(2,j)]);
                }
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], r+1+dp[upper-i]);
            }
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
};
```
