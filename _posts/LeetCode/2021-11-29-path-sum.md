## Description

LeetCode Problem 112.

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.
```

Example 2: 
```
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false
Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
Output: false
Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.
```

Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
* -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
* -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

## Sample C++ Code


```c
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkPathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum, int accu) {
        if ((root->left == NULL) && (root->right == NULL)) {
            if (accu + root->val == sum)
                return true;
            else
                return false;
        } else if (root->left == NULL) {
            return checkPathSum(root->right, sum, accu+root->val);
        } else if (root->right == NULL) {
            return checkPathSum(root->left, sum, accu+root->val);
        } else {
            return ((checkPathSum(root->left, sum, accu+root->val) || (checkPathSum(root->right, sum, accu+root->val))));
        }
        
    }
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        if (root == NULL)
            return false;
        return checkPathSum(root, sum, 0);
    }
};
```
