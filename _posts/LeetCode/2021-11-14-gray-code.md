## Description

LeetCode Problem 89. 

An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of 2^n integers where:

* Every integer is in the inclusive range [0, 2^n - 1],
* The first integer is 0,
* An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,
* The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and
* The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.

Given an integer n, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.


Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
- 00 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 00 differ by one bit
[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
- 00 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 00 differ by one bit
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: [0,1]
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 16

## Sample C++ Code


```c
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> ans;
    
    int toDecimal(vector<int>& bin) {
        int dec = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < bin.size(); i ++) {
            dec = (dec << 1) + bin[i];
        }
        return dec;
    }
    
    void backtrack(vector<int>& candidates, int idx) {
        if (idx == -1) {
            ans.push_back(toDecimal(candidates));
            return;
        }
        
        backtrack(candidates, idx-1);
        candidates[idx] = 1 - candidates[idx];
        backtrack(candidates, idx-1);
                
        
    }
    
    vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        vector<int> candidates(n, 0);
        backtrack(candidates, n-1);
        return ans;
    }
};
```
