## Description

LeetCode Problem 274.

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their i^th paper, return compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n &minus; h papers have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Example 1:
```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:
* n == citations.length
* 1 <= n <= 5000
* 0 <= citations[i] <= 1000

<br />

## Sample C++ Code


```c
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int len = citations.size();
        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end());

        if (len == 1)
            return (citations[0] == 0) ? 0 : 1;
        
        int left = 0, right = len-1;
        int mid;

        while (left <= right) {
            mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (citations[mid] == (len-mid))
                return len-mid;
            else if (citations[mid] < (len-mid)) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
            
        }
        return len-left;
    }
};
```
